NsqSharp
========

A .NET client library for [NSQ](https://github.com/bitly/nsq), a realtime distributed messaging platform.

## Work in Progress

This project is currently under development.

If you want to use NSQ from .NET today, check out [NSQnet](https://github.com/ClothesHorse/NSQnet).

## Goals
- NsqSharp aims to be a structurally similar port of the official NSQ client, [go-nsq](https://github.com/bitly/go-nsq).
- As a result of structural similarity, this project aims to keep the client up to date with the latest stable release of go-nsq, and provide developers with similar behavior and semantics as the official package.
