NsqSharp
========

A .NET client library for [NSQ](https://github.com/bitly/nsq), a realtime distributed messaging platform.

## Work in Progress

This project is currently under development.

If you want to use NSQ within .NET today, check out [NSQnet](https://github.com/ClothesHorse/NSQnet).

## Goals
- Structurally similar to the official [go-nsq](https://github.com/bitly/go-nsq) client.
- Up to date with the latest stable release of go-nsq.
- Provide similar behavior and semantics as the official package.
